I am a Computer Science graduate student at Virginia Tech, USA with over 4 years of experience working as a Software Engineer in India and Singapore. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Mandi. I am enthusiastic about creating intriguing software that uses technology to meet human needs. I am a quick learner, and my experience allows me to quickly pick up new technologies. I look forward to opportunities where I can use my theoretical knowledge and put it to more practical use. Feel free to reach out!
